# Akordi

A simple chord player app I built as a helper tool when learning modal interchange.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Allow only one chord to be played at a time
- [ ] Add MIDI out
- [ ] Add a piano-like SoundFont
- [ ] Support custom chord inversions
- [ ] Custom layouts
- [ ] Add an Omnichord-style strum pad
- [ ] Add synth controls

### Credits

- [AudioKit](https://audiokit.io/): synthesis and midi.
